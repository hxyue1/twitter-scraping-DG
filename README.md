# Twitter Scraping Desiring God tweets

This will be my first foray into twitter scraping and natural language processing. The twitter account is: https://twitter.com/desiringGod?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor.

The plan is to ultimately create a web app/dashboard that analyses different tweets and predicts how many likes and retweets it will get. Still in its early stages, let's see if this can take off. The first thing to do will be to create a script or notebook that can actually 
scrape the tweets.
